# Voice-Activated-Calculator
This is a voice activated calculator, created with python. 


How I will make it: 
I would be using openAI's API, but unfortunately, it's not free, like most API's. 
Instead, I will be making different functions, each will do a different type of math (i.e. multiplication, division etc...)

Three Step Process:

1. Create functions for audio: 
    - Create a function that records audio
    - Create a function that converts audio to text for visual interaction
    - Create a function that converts text to audio, so that the output would be in text, and then converted to audio
    - Create a function that listens for a starting keyword, just like google uses "ok google", or "hey google",
    instead the user will be able to name the assistant, and then they keyword they would use is the custom-named assistant

2. Create seperate functions for math:
    - Different types of math functions are used in different types of ways. If the user says "what is 2 times 2", the program should be able 
    to detect that the user means multiplication. If the user says "whats the square root of 2", the program should recognize that 
    the user wants to use the square root

3. Test the project
    - For testing, I will be using it myself, on a high-level-usage standard, meaning that I will be using it every day


Further Steps:

With this code, I am planning to place it in an app. First android and then iOS.
